Elements which have at-least two greater elements
Problem Description

You are given an array of distinct integers A, you have to find and return all elements in array which have at-least two greater elements than themselves.

NOTE: The result should have the order in which they are present in the original array.



Problem Constraints
3 <= |A| <= 105

-109 <= A[i] <= 109



Input Format
First and only argument is an integer array A.



Output Format
Return an integer array containing the elements of A which have at-least two greater elements than themselves in A.



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Input 2:

 A = [11, 17, 100, 5]


Example Output
Output 1:

 [1, 2, 3]
Output 2:

 [11, 5]


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 Number of elements greater than 1: 4
 Number of elements greater than 2: 3
 Number of elements greater than 3: 2
 Number of elements greater than 4: 1
 Number of elements greater than 5: 0
 Elements 1, 2 and 3 have atleast 2 elements strictly greater than themselves.
Explanation 2:

 Number of elements greater than 11: 2
 Number of elements greater than 17: 1
 Number of elements greater than 100: 0
 Number of elements greater than 5: 3
 Elements 5 and 11 have atleast 2 elements strictly greater than themselves.
 
 
 
 
 solution:
 vector<int> Solution::solve(vector<int> &arr) {
    int n = arr.size();
    int first = INT_MIN, 
        second = INT_MIN;
        vector<int>ans;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        /* If current element is smaller 
        than first then update both first 
        and second */
        if (arr[i] > first)
        {
            second = first;
            first = arr[i];
        }
 
        /* If arr[i] is in between first 
        and second then update second */
        else if (arr[i] > second)
            second = arr[i];
    }
 
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        if (arr[i] < second)
          ans.push_back(arr[i]);
return ans;
}
