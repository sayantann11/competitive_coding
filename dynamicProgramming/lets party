Problem Description

In Danceland, one person can party either alone or can pair up with another person.

Can you find in how many ways they can party if there are A people in Danceland?

Note: Return your answer modulo 10003, as the answer can be large.



Problem Constraints
1 <= A <= 105



Input Format
Given only argument A of type Integer, number of people in Danceland.



Output Format
Return an integer denoting the number of ways people of Danceland can party.



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = 3
Input 2:

 A = 5


Example Output
Output 1:

 4
Output 2:

 26


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 Let suppose three people are A, B, and C. There are only 4 ways to party
 (A, B, C) All party alone
 (AB, C) A and B party together and C party alone
 (AC, B) A and C party together and B party alone
 (BC, A) B and C party together and A
 here 4 % 10003 = 4, so answer is 4.
 
Explanation 2:

 Number of ways they can party are: 26.
int Solution::solve(int x) {
    // Base condition
    if (x==0 || x==1)    
        return 1;
 
    // A participant can choose to consider
    // (1) Remains single. Number of people
    //     reduce to (x-1)
    // (2) Pairs with one of the (x-1) others.
    //     For every pairing, number of people
    //     reduce to (x-2).
    else
        return solve(x-1) +
               (x-1)*solve(x-2);
}
