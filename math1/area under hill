Area under the hills
Problem Description

Rishik likes to draw a lot. He starts at origin and chooses a single Y ordinate of each abscissa in [1-N] given in array A and then chooses 0 for N+1. He then joins each consecutive point with a straight line and found that he has drawn a masterpiece. But, It is incomplete without coloring.

So, he wants you to tell him the area of hills that he will color.



Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 2e5

1 <= A[i] <= 2e9



Input Format
First and only argument of input contains a single integer array A.



Output Format
Return a string denoting area of hills(with truncated/rounded down decimal).



Example Input
Input 1:

 [2, 1, 3]
Input 2:

 [10]


Example Output
Output 1:

 "6"
Output 2:

 "10"


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

See Image for diagram, Area under curve is 6.


string Solution::solve(vector<int> &A) {
    long long int n=A.size();
    long long int sum=0;
    for(long long int i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
            sum = sum+A[i];
    }
    string str  = to_string(sum);
    return str;
}
